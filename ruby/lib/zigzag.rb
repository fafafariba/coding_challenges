# A sequence of integers is called a zigzag sequence if each of its elements is either strictly less than both neighbors or strictly greater than both neighbors. For example, the sequence 4 2 3 1 5 3 is a zigzag, but 7 3 5 5 2 and 3 8 6 4 5 aren't.

# For a given array of integers return the length of its longest contiguous sub-array that is a zigzag sequence.

# Example

# For a = [9, 8, 8, 5, 3, 5, 3, 2, 8, 6], the output should be
# zigzag(a) = 4.

# The longest zigzag sub-arrays are [5, 3, 5, 3] and [3, 2, 8, 6] and they both have length 4.
